# Spacebar-Counter
Basically, you just click spacebar and you count it and I prefer click for 1 minute on your spacebar really quick with your friends and when the times up, you can see who got the fastest one. 

  <div id="activity">
  <h1 id="counter">You have hit the spacebar <span class="hits">0</span> times.</h1>
  <a href="#" onclick="resetHits()" class="tryagain">RESTART</a>
		</div>
